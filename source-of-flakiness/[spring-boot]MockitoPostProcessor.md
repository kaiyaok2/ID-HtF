## Description:
In the function `postProcessBeanFactory()`, a `parser` of type `DefinitionsParser` is initiated, and `parser.getDefinitions()` is called to retrieve a `Set` of definitions. The code then loops through the `Set` to register the definitions used for Mockito Beans(by adding a `bean` object to `MockitoBeans`). The problem is that the Beans registration shall have deterministic order, since some fields / annotations are dependent on others. This is addressed in `DefinitionsParser`, where its constructor initialized the set of definitions as a `LinkedHashSet`, and the map of definition fields as a `LinkedHashMap`. However, when `DefinitionsParser` gets a `Class<?>` input, it parses its annotations / fields using the Java default `getDeclaredFields()` and `getDeclaredAnnotations()` methods, which are themselves non-deterministic. For example, `parser()` in `DefinitionsParser` called `ReflectionUtils.doWithFields()` to parse the fields, and `doWithFields()` eventually loops through the array returned by the Java `getDeclaredFields()`. Therefore, there are no guaranteed orders in the `LinkedHashSet` and `LinkedHashMap` mentioned above.

## Additional Information:
To deterministically reproduce test failure, it's recommended to use the `-DnondexMode=ONE` option, because the order dependency in Mockito Beans can only emerge in certain orders.
